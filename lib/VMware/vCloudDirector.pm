=head1 NAME

VMware::vCloudDirector - Interface to VMWare vCloud Directory REST API

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # THIS IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT - PROTOTYPING REALLY
    # IT MAY CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OR EAT YOUR DATA.

    use VMware::vCloudDirector

    my $vcd = VMware::vCloudDirector->new(
        hostname   => $host,
        username   => $user,
        password   => $pass,
        orgname    => $org,
        ssl_verify => 0,
    );
    my @org_list = $vcd->org_list;

=head2 Attributes

=head3 hostname

Hostname of the vCloud server.  Must have a vCloud instance listening for https
on port 443.

=head3 username

Username to use to login to vCloud server.

=head3 password

Password to use to login to vCloud server.

=head3 orgname

Org name to use to login to vCloud server - this defaults to C<System>.

=head3 timeout

Command timeout in seconds.  Defaults to 120.

=head3 default_accept_header

The default MIME types to accept.  This is automatically set based on the
information received back from the API versions.

=head3 ssl_verify

Whether to do standard SSL certificate verification.  Defaults to set.

=head3 ssl_ca_file

The SSL CA set to trust packaged in a file.  This defaults to those set in the
L<Mozilla::CA>

=head2 debug

Set debug level.  The higher the debug level, the more chatter is exposed.

Defaults to 0 (no output) unless the environment variable C<VCLOUD_API_DEBUG>
is set to something that is non-zero.  Picked up at create time in C<BUILD()>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Thinish wrapper of the VMware vCloud Director REST API.

THIS IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT - PROTOTYPING REALLY - AND MAY CHANGE
DRAMATICALLY OR EAT YOUR DATA.

The target application is to read information from a vCloud instance, so the
ability to change or write data to the vCloud system has not been implemented
as yet...
